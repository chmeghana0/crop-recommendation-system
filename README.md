📌Crop Recommendation System:
This project is a simple machine learning–based web application that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and weather conditions.
It is built using Python and Flask and is intended as a beginner-friendly ML deployment project.
------
📌About the Project:
Agriculture depends a lot on factors like soil nutrients, temperature, rainfall, and humidity.
Choosing the wrong crop can reduce yield.
This project helps by:
Taking soil and environmental inputs
Processing them using a trained ML model
Predicting the best crop for the given conditions
------
📌Technologies Used:
Python, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, HTML & CSS
------
📌Input Details
The following values are taken as input from the user:
Nitrogen (N)
Phosphorus (P)
Potassium (K)
Temperature
Humidity
pH value
Rainfall
------
📌How the Project Works:
1.The user enters soil and climate values in the web form.
2.The input data is scaled using MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler.
3.A trained machine learning model processes the data.
4.The predicted crop name is displayed on the webpage.
------
📌Running the Project in VS Code:
1.Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code
2.Open a new terminal inside VS Code
3.Make sure Python is installed on the system
4.Install the required libraries such as Flask, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn
5.Run the app.py file from the VS Code terminal
6.After the server starts, a local address will be shown in the terminal
7.Open that address in a web browser to view the application

📌Note
This project may require compatible versions of NumPy and Scikit-learn
to run locally, as the ML model was trained using specific library versions.
